	<header>Hi, I want to get better at webdev, That's why I'm doing these tasks and attending my lectures.</header>

			I assume that since we haven't gotten into styling with css in these lectures yet, I won't have to care about css.
			<br>
			CSS is a great way to style your webpage, but at the end of the day noone cares about this webpage, so why should I care about making it look good?!

			<br>
			I'm simply here to make a webpage that's supposed to follow standards and use the correct elements/tags, even though everyone on the internet just uses divs for everything anyway...
			<br>
			Oh, and by the way, I use the <code>&lthr&gt</code> tags to separate my <code>&ltheader&gt</code>, <code>&ltmain&gt</code>, and <code>&ltfooter&gt</code>, because even though I'm not supposed to style my html quite yet I can't stand the single blob of text I get if I don't.

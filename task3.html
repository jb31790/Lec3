		<h1>Semantically correct HTML</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			During this lecture we've been exploring and learning about writing <strong>semantically correct HTML</strong>.
			One could immediately argue that you don't actually have to write semantically correct html, so let's discuss why that is.
		</p>
		<h2>HTML = Freedom</h2>
		<p>
			HTML is a very simple language to learn since it doesn't have a lot of strict rules. For example, this article is written inside a <code>&ltarticle&gt</code> tag, but I've commented out the closing tag. This is fully possible in HTML, and will <em>most likely</em> render correctly on the client.

		<h1>Task 3</h1>
		<p>I started out by writing a discussion about <em>semantically correct HTML</em>, but after some time I realized that it doesn't really matter... By now I hope you have realized that I'm not new to <strong>html</strong> and <strong>css</strong>, I'm here to learn <strong>Javascript</strong>, so thats what I'll do from now on. Of course I'll do the tasks and labs required, but thats about it.</p>
		<p>
			<em>PS. I think the <code>&ltmark&gt</code> tag produces absolutely horrendous output. I'm not entirely sure if the tasks/assignment requires all of the listed tags specifically, but here we go: <mark>ughhthhhg</mark></em>
		</p>
		<h2>The List</h2>
		<p>
			Originally I forgot to showcase that I do in fact know how to make a list in html, but here you go:

			<i>You may also have noticed that I usually don't like to write about myself or my hobbies in my assignments like the tasks specify, but here you go:</i>

		<h3>Three things I like</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Penguins</li>
			<li>Tea</li>
			<li>Containers (like docker containers, not IRL containers)</li>

		</ol>
